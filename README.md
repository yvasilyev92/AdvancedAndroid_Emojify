# AdvancedAndroid_Emojify

This is the Emojify app part of Udacity's Advanced Android Development course Part 2 -- Using Libraries.

Original repo: https://github.com/udacity/AdvancedAndroid_Emojify

This app uses the Google Mobile Vision library for Facial Recognition, Butterknife, and Timber libraries to take selfies and turn your face into an Emoji based on your facial
expression.

This app shows how to use the Mobile Vision Library, In-app Camera uses and permissions, Bitmaps and the BitmapFactory class as well
as a BitmapUtils class, File and Media Storage,  Image processing, and Activity callbacks.
